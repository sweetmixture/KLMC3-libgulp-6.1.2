Madelung is a simple code to compute the correction of a net charged defect
in a solid. This is an extension of the method of Leslie and Gillan to 
systems with any cell shape and an anisotropic dielectric constant.

Installation:
-------------

There are only 2 routines and so they can be compiled using any Fortran compiler:

gfortran -o madelung madelung.f90 matinv.f90

Execution:
----------

./madelung < input


Input file format:
------------------

Only 3 things are needed for the input:
1) The cell vectors in Angstroms
2) The dielectric constant tensor in the same orientation as the cell
   - a unit matrix can be supplied if no dielectric constant is required
3) The charge of the defect (NB: sign doesn't matter since the energy depends on Q^2)

Example of the input for Al2O3 in a 3x3x1 hexagonal supercell when computing
an Al vacancy:

vectors   
  14.460163    0.000000    0.000000
  -7.230082   12.522869    0.000000
   0.000000    0.000000   13.011658
dielectric
 11.29307   0.00000   0.00000
  0.00000  11.29307   0.00000
  0.00000   0.00000  16.36466
3.0       ! Charge

Output:
-------

Although the components of the energy are output, all that is really needed is the
final non-blank line:

 Energy correction   =     1.072116 eV

This is the energy that has to be added to the charged-supercell defect energy from
GULP to correct the PBC result to the isolated defect one. 

NB: This only corrects the dominant Coulomb charge-charge term. For small cells the
higher multipoles may also require correction. Similarly the elastic interaction is
not corrected for either, though this should often be small for a large cell.
