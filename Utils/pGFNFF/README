pGFN-FF Library
---------------

This code contains a set of routines that build a library that is useful for generating
the parameters required to run a GFN-FF calculation or the periodic equivalent, pGFN-FF.

The starting point for the main part of the parameter generation is the original GFN-FF
force field of Spicher and Grimme, Angewandte Chemie Intl. Ed., 131, 11195 (2020) and
associated code within the XTB program. This has been modified to allow for the changes
proposed in the pGFN-FF method by Gale, LeBlance, Spackman, Silvestri and Raiteri, 
J. Chem. Theory Comput., 17, 7827 (2021).

The code provided contains the routines to create the library and an example main program
that calls the library to generate the relevant parameters. 

Installation:

1) By default the installation will use gfortran as the compiler. If you wish to change
this then edit the Makefile

2) To build just the library, type:

make lib

3) To build an executable "pGFNFF" based no main.F90 calling the library, type:

make exe
