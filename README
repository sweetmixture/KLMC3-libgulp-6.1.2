Distribution for GULP 6.1 :
===========================

The following is a guide to the directories that should be present in this distribution :

Docs        : documentation and information relating to the program
Examples    : example input files for the program
Libraries   : library files for the program
Src         : source code and files relating to the installation of the program
Utils       : utility routines associated with GULP

To install GULP on most Unix/Linux machines :

(1) Go to Src/
(2) Type "./mkgulp"
    NB: There are several flags that can be added depending on what options are
        required. The main options are:
        -h => print help text to list the options below
        -m => parallel compilation with MPI
        -d => compile with debug options
        -e => compile with ELPA maths library (NB: Assumes version elpa-2020.05.001 is installed)
        -f => compile with FFTW3 for Smooth Particle Mesh Ewald
        -k => compile with OpenKIM (needs version 2.0)
        -p => compile with Plumed plug-in
        -c ARG => change the compiler to "ARG". gfortran (default) and intel are supported.
        -j ARG => specify the number of cores to be used for task (i.e. make -j)

        -t ARG => change the task to ARG. gulp (default), clean, lib, tar, fox-clean
(3) If the above fails - edit "mkgulp" and correct the settings for your machine
    NB: Look for the string "USER" for places where you may need to edit things that
        are specific to your machine. Usually the libraries are in a different location
        or not installed if compilation fails.
(4) Set the following environment variables to indicate where the program files can
    be found:

    GULP_LIB    The location of the Libraries directory
    GULP_DOC    The location of the Doc directory
    ALAMODE_DIR The main directory for the alamode code for thermal conductivity calculations
                NB: The current version works with either Alamode version 1.0.2, 1.1.0 or 1.3.0

Compiler notes:
---------------
1) gfortran: Compilation requires version 4.6 or more recent 
             NB: The -fallow-argument-mismatch flag is specified which is needed for gfortran v10 onwards
                 For older versions then this can be removed (or copy mkgulp_old_gfortran to mkgulp)
2) Intel: Some old versions may fail to compile, but the following have been tested and verified to work:
   2019.3.199
   2018.1.163
   2017.4.056
   17.0.0.098
   16.0.1.150
   15.0.0.090
3) If using Intel MPI (as opposed to say OpenMPI) then it will be necessary to edit mkgulp to comment/uncomment
lines to select the names "mpiifort" and "mpiicc" for the parallel compilation wrappers.

Mac OSX:
--------

Most libraries on which GULP depends can be installed using Homebrew or Macports (note that mkgulp may
need to be modified accordingly).
For lapack and blas then the best option is to use -framework accelerate on the compile line (default).
